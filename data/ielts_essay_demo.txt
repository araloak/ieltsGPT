It is observed that the definition of family evolves over recent years. As growing number of people choose to build a family out of personal preference rather than a sense of responsibility, I believe that this changing of life style effects individuals and society in a positive way.
The new generation tends to dive into marriages out of their own willingness instead of moral obligation. Reproduction, one of the core functionality of a traditional family, becomes less significant in the mind of young couples as many ==prioritise== their career in life. In the past, economic ==property== was also a key factor in deciding whether to get married. However, modern lovers consider more about their feelings and mental connection with each other rather than their partners’ financial status. Last but not (the?) least, same sex marriage is legalized in more and more countries, echoing people’s pursuit of their true identity and what they want.
The changing of family structure benefits both individually and socially as it caters to the needs of the new generation. As people form a family out of their free will, it decreases the chances of arguing or even fighting for different stances, allowing a loving and caring family ==automsphere==. In the social level, less moral pressure on marriages allows the young people to develop themselves more freely and enjoy their own life. In addition, more diverse family types brings more business opportunities, which brings good to the economy.
In conclusion, personal interests is replacing moral responsibility as an more important role in having a family. It seems to me that the phenomenon has many benefits.
