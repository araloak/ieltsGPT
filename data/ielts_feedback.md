## Task Description
In recent years, the family structure and the role of its members are gradually changing. What kinds of changes can occur? Do you think these changes are positive and negative?

## Essay:
It is observed that the definition of family evolves over recent years. As growing number of people choose to build a family out of personal preference rather than a sense of responsibility, I believe that this changing of life style effects individuals and society in a positive way.

The new generation tends to dive into marriages out of their own willingness instead of moral obligation. Reproduction, one of the core functionality of a traditional family, becomes less significant in the mind of young couples as many ==prioritise== their career in life. In the past, economic ==property== was also a key factor in deciding whether to get married. However, modern lovers consider more about their feelings and mental connection with each other rather than their partners’ financial status. Last but not (the?) least, same sex marriage is legalized in more and more countries, echoing people’s pursuit of their true identity and what they want.

The changing of family structure benefits both individually and socially as it caters to the needs of the new generation. As people form a family out of their free will, it decreases the chances of arguing or even fighting for different stances, allowing a loving and caring family ==automsphere==. In the social level, less moral pressure on marriages allows the young people to develop themselves more freely and enjoy their own life. In addition, more diverse family types brings more business opportunities, which brings good to the economy.

In conclusion, personal interests is replacing moral responsibility as an more important role in having a family. It seems to me that the phenomenon has many benefits.

## Coherence and Cohesion
Overall, the essay is well-organized with adequate coherence and cohesion. The writer manages to present a clear introduction and a relevant conclusion that encapsulate the main ideas and arguments presented in the body paragraphs. However, there are some areas for improvement that can enhance the coherence and cohesion of the essay.

Firstly, there are some inaccurate vocabulary choices that lead to unclear meanings. For instance, the word “prioritise” in the second sentence of the second paragraph should be “prioritize”. Moreover, the word “property” in the same sentence is not the appropriate term to use; instead, “consideration” or “factor” would be more fitting. Furthermore, in the third sentence of the same paragraph, the writer uses the phrase “mental connection” which is not commonly used in English; “emotional connection” would be a better option. Such inaccuracies affect the clarity of the writer’s ideas and weaken the coherence of the essay.

Secondly, the writer could have included more specific cohesive devices to link sentences and paragraphs and to indicate the relationships between ideas. Although the essay uses some basic connectors such as “As”, “In addition”, “Lastly”, and “In conclusion”, these are insufficient to achieve a high score in coherence and cohesion. The writer could have used more varied connectors such as “Furthermore”, “Additionally”, “Moreover”, “On the other hand”, and “Nevertheless” to demonstrate a more sophisticated capacity to link ideas and to create a cohesive flow of information. For example, the writer could have used the phrase “In addition” to connect the third sentence of the second paragraph to the preceding sentences.

Finally, the essay is well-structured, but the use of subheadings could further enhance the coherence and cohesion of the essay. The writer could have used headings such as “Traditional Family vs. Modern Family”, “Benefits of Personal Choice in Family Building”, and “Societal Impacts of Changing Family Structures” to clarify the organization of the essay and to provide readers with an overview of the main points discussed. This would have improved the coherence and cohesion of the essay by creating a clear roadmap for the reader.

In summary, the essay demonstrates a good level of coherence and cohesion, but there are some areas that require improvement. The writer can achieve a higher score by using more appropriate vocabulary, varied and precise connectors, and subheadings to organize the ideas and to link the sentences and paragraphs more effectively. Based on these observations, the essay can be given a score of 7 for coherence and cohesion.

## Lexical Resource
Feedback:
Overall, the essay addresses the prompt and presents a clear argument in favor of the changes occurring in family structures and roles. The writer effectively uses transitional phrases to lead readers through the essay and presents thoughtful ideas. There are moments when the essay is well-written and demonstrates an appropriate level of vocabulary. However, there are other places where the vocabulary is less precise, making the writing weaker.

Merits:
The writer clearly understands the importance of variety in their vocabulary, and there are moments where they use a wide range of appropriate words. They demonstrate good use of transitional phrases, including “In addition” and “Last but not least”. These transitions help the essay to flow and make it easier for readers to follow the writer’s logic.

Flaws:
At times, the vocabulary is basic, and the writer repeats words or uses phrases that seem awkward or do not exactly fit the meaning they intend to express. In particular, the use of “prioritize” is not appropriate in one of the essay’s key sentences. “Property” is also used in a way that is unusual and not precise enough to convey the intended meaning. Finally, there are moments where the essay suffers from mild grammatical mistakes or imprecise language choices. For instance, “atmosphere” is spelled incorrectly.

Score:
Considering the criteria described in the prompt, I would recommend a Lexical Resource score of band 6 for this essay. The essay shows an effort to use less common vocabulary, but there are frequent errors and moments where the sentences are less precise than they could be. The writer does not display a wide enough range of vocabulary to warrant a score of band 7 or higher, but the writing can still be understood.

## Grammatical Range and Accuracy
The essay displays a relatively good command of grammar and its structures, although there are some flaws that hinder its coherence and clarity. 

In terms of simple structures, the essay uses varied tenses and sentence structures to convey different ideas. For instance, the writer uses simple present tense to describe the changes in family structures, and simple past tense to discuss the past attitudes towards family. The essay also employs complex sentences, such as using subordinating conjunctions like “as”, “however”, and “which” to provide additional information and connect related ideas. One example of a complex sentence is: “The new generation tends to dive into marriages out of their own willingness instead of moral obligation, reproduction, one of the core functionality of a traditional family, becomes less significant in the mind of young couples as many prioritize their career in life.”

However, there are some grammatical errors and typos that impede the clarity of the essay. For instance, there are instances of wrong word choice, such as “effects” instead of “affects” in the first sentence and “automsphere” instead of “atmosphere” in the fourth paragraph. There are also a few instances of verb tense inconsistencies, such as “many prioritize” instead of “many prioritizeD” and “same-sex marriage is legalized” instead of “has been legalized”. Finally, some sentences towards the end of the essay are unclear, such as the following: “In conclusion, personal interests is replacing moral responsibility as an more important role in having a family.”

Overall, I would score this essay as a Band 6 for Grammatical Range and Accuracy. The essay shows evidence of a fair range of grammatical structures, although there are some noticeable errors here and there that affect clarity and coherence. The writer should be more careful in proofreading and understanding the rules of verb tense consistency and word choice.

Task Achievement: 
The essay partially addresses the given prompt by discussing the changing family structure and the positive impact it has on society.
