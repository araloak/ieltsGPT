## Task Description & My Writing:
### Task description:

Your professor is teaching a class on computer science. Write a post responding to the professor’s question.  In your response, you should express and support your personal opinion make a contribution to the discussion in your own words. An effective response will contain at least 100 words.

Professor:  A new story about Artificial Intelligence (AI) is in the news almost every day.  And, of course, companies are spending an enormous amount of money to develop new technologies related to AI.  Before next class, I want you to consider the following question: Is AI a dangerous technology that, overall, will be harmful to society, or is it a powerful tool that will improve the lives of people?

Megan: Personally, I think AI is a threat. As AI advances, many jobs may become automated, leaving people without work. That will certainly increase income inequality. Additionally, there’s the risk that AI systems could be programmed with biases or used to discriminate against certain groups. We need to be careful and ensure that AI is developed in an ethical and responsible way.  Since we can’t guarantee that right now, I think it is best to slow down.

David: I disagree with Megan. I’m of the opinion that AI has the potential to solve many of the world’s problems, from climate change to disease. Additionally, AI can help us make better decisions by analyzing vast amounts of data and identifying patterns that humans may miss. That said, I agree with Megan that we must ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible way that benefits society as a whole.



### Writing for Evaluation:

While I can understand both points of view, I think that AI is mostly helpful and will improve our lives over time. Like David, I’m really confident that AI will help us deal with many serious problems currently affecting society.  It has already been used to make driving safer and reduce car accidents, so we currently have some proof that AI is helping people around the world.  According to statistics I read last week, self-driving cars get in accidents 80% less frequently than cars driven by humans. That seems like an incredible advantage to me.  Remember that new technologies are always scary at first, but we shouldn’t let our fears prevent us from making progress.

## Feedback
### Evaluation of Writing Response

#### Topic Relevance:
The response effectively addresses the prompt by discussing whether AI is a dangerous technology or a beneficial tool. The writer presents a clear stance that AI improves lives and supports this with an example of self-driving cars, which relate directly to the discussion about AI's impacts.

#### Development of Ideas:
The response is well-developed in terms of presenting a clear opinion and supporting it with specific, relevant examples. The mention of self-driving cars and their statistical safety compared to human-driven cars is a concrete example that strengthens the argument. Additionally, the writer’s acknowledgment of common fears associated with new technologies provides a balanced view, showing an understanding of the broader implications and discussions surrounding AI advancements.

#### Language Use:
The language in the response is generally clear and coherent. The use of phrases such as "mostly helpful," "serious problems currently affecting society," and "incredible advantage" clearly convey the writer's positive stance towards AI. Moreover, the transition from acknowledging both perspectives to supporting one is smoothly handled, maintaining the flow of the argument.

However, there are minor issues affecting the response’s clarity and grammatical correctness:
- The phrase "It has already been used to make driving safer and reduce car accidents" can be improved for clarity. A more direct restructuring could be, "AI has already made driving safer by reducing car accidents."
- Absence of source citation for the statistics mentioned might slightly weaken the argumentative power of the example, although it’s understandable in the context of a timed, exam setting.
- Some sentences could benefit from tighter construction for enhanced impact and readability.

#### Sentence Variety and Vocabulary:
The response shows a reasonable range of sentence structures and vocabulary. There is a good mix of simple and complex sentences that help maintain reader interest. Terms like “incredible advantage” and “serious problems” are appropriately academic and contribute positively to the discussion's tone.

#### Conclusion:
Overall, the response presents a coherent argument supported by relevant examples and generally effective language use. While there is room for improvement in the precision of language and expansion of the discussion with further examples or deeper analysis, it accomplishes the task set by the prompt satisfactorily.

#### Recommended Score:
Considering the described criteria and the demonstrated capabilities in the response, I would assign this response a score of **4 (A generally successful response)**. The response is relevant, mostly well-articulated, and the examples provided are appropriate, though it could benefit from more varied sentence structures and a deeper exploration of the topic to reach a score of 5. The minor language issues noted do not significantly impede understanding, aligning with expectations for a generally successful response.
